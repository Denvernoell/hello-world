# About-Me

Welcome,

Denver here, Civil Engineering student who wants to make the live's of those around me easier by trying to learn **Python** and **VBA** to the best of my ability so that I can automate and simplify complex tasks. I am also working on improving my *cooking* and enjoy *pickleball*, *juggling*, and *yoga*.

One thing that I want to get better at is using **Notion** to create a resource that has notes and examples from projects and books so that I can *quickly reference* instead of *relearning everything* from scratch when a problem comes up.
