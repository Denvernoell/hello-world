# hello-world

Welcome,

Denver here, Civil Engineering student who wants to make the live's of those around me easiertrying to learn Python and VBA to the best of my ability to enhance my data analysis skills. Also passionate about cooking, pickleball, and yoga.

One thing that I want to get better at is using **Notion** to create a resource that has notes and examples from projects and books so that I can *quickly reference* instead of *relearning everything* from scratch when a problem comes up.
